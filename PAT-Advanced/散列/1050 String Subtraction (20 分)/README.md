# 1050 String Subtraction (20 分)
> Given two strings S<sub>1</sub>​​ and S<sub>2</sub>​​ , S=S<sub>1</sub>​​ −S<sub>​2</sub>​​ is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in S<sub>2</sub>​​ from S<sub>1</sub>​​. Your task is simply to calculate S<sub>1</sub>​​ −S<sub>​2</sub>​​ for any given strings. However, it might not be that simple to do it fast.

> ## Input Specification:
> Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which gives S<sub>1</sub>​​ and S<sub>2</sub>​​, respectively. The string lengths of both strings are no more than 10<sup>4</sup>​​. It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.

> ## Output Specification:
> For each test case, print S<sub>1</sub>​​ −S<sub>​2</sub>​​ in one line.

> ## Sample Input:
> They are students.<br>
> aeiou<br>
> ## Sample Output:
> Thy r stdnts.
